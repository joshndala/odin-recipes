        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I can never get enough of chocolate chip cookies, and neither can my 
            friends when I bake for them! Making them from scratch means you'll get a fresh batch 
        when you want, and the dough can be frozen for when you want to bake more later.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup salted butter</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup light brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flower</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp sea salt</li>
            <li>2 cups chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F, and set aside a baking pan with parchment paper</li>
            <li>In one bowl, mix the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt</li>
            <li>In another bowl, mix the butter and sugars until creamy. Then mix in the eggs and vanilla</li>
            <li>Add the dry ingredients mixture to the creamy bowl and mix</li>
            <li>Add the chocolate chips and mix</li>
            <li>Roll 2-3 tbs (or however big you want your cookies to be) of dough into balls and place them 
                evenly spaced on the baking pan
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the oven for approximately 8-10 minutes</li>
            <li>Set aside for 2 minutes before moving them onto a cooling rack</li>
        </ol>
